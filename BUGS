This is a list of things we are currently not handling.

(Some of them may not need handling, but require testing to prove that
it is safe to not do so.)

* The application name passed into the ApplicationDriver.new call has
to be a String.  There is no support for Duck Typing.

* If the listener is only effective once the SPI main loop is running
(which seems reasonable, otherwise events would have to be queued up
somewhere) then we have a hole in our application detection.  It could
start after we look on the Desktop, and before we start the loop.

* Timeout if the app doesn't appear.

* Not tidying up correctly when raise an exception.

* Should add '-std=c99' to CFLAGS used by mkmf
