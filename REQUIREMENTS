This project is being developed using Ruby 1.9.  This version of Ruby
has been available for ages and this project is not yet production-
ready, so using what is technically a development release is not an
issue.  When and if Zhaki becomes production-ready, I'll reassess the
situation and see if requiring 1.9 is necessary and reasonable.

This project is being developed on Ubuntu 10.04 (the key bit being
Gnome with a Bonobo layer).

For the code to work, you need Assistive Technologies turned on.
System -> Preferences -> Assistive Technologies ->
    select 'Enable assistive technologies'
This requires a re-login to fully take effect.

You need gcc, so install the build-essential package.
Also the libatspi-dev package.

(There may be other requirements.  When I get a chance, I will test it
out on a clean (probably VM) system.)
