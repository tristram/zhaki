This project uses Ruby 1.9.  It has been available for ages and this
is not yet a production-ready project.  When and if, I'll assess the
situation and see if requiring 1.9 is necessary and reasonable.

This project uses Ubuntu 10.04 (specifically Gnome with a Bonobo
layer).
For the code to work, you need Assistive Technologies turned on.
System -> Preferences -> Assistive Technologies ->
    select 'Enable assistive technologies'
This requires a re-login to fully take effect.

You need gcc, so install the build-essential package.
Also the pkg-config package.
