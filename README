The Zhaki project aims to provide a GUI testing tool.

It is inspired by WindowLicker, but is not tied to the Java VM.
Instead it is built on AT-SPI, the accessibility layer developed by
the Gnome project.  Initially it is restricted to Ruby on Gnome, but
the AT-SPI layer is intended to become cross-platform, and other
language bindings should be feasible.

The other main difference to WindowLicker is that using AT-SPI should
allow Zhaki to use an event-driven model, rather than a polling model.
(Polling is usually a poor way to handle concurrency.)

This will be a voyage of discovery: I do not have any experience of
using AT-SPI, and it currently appears to be in a state of flux.  The
CORBA layer (Bonobo) underpinning it is being replaced by D-Bus.  I am
developing on Ubuntu 10.04, where Bonobo is still being used, so shall
target the Bonobo version until 10.10 comes out.
